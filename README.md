This is a Basic Banking Website!

I have used the following to make this:

Front-End : HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
Back-End : PHP
Database : mySQL from PHPAdmin

IDE: VS Code

The System is Simple, with a HOME Page followed by the List of Customers and their Account Balances.
You can Transfer money from one customer to the other!

Once a valid transaction is made, you will see the summary of all the transactions that have taken place!
